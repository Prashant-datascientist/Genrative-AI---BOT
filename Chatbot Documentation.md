# Chatbot Development Documentation

## Overview:
The task involves developing a chatbot capable of interacting with users and providing information based on data extracted from a website. The development process utilizes the Llama Index framework for generating responses to user queries. The chatbot should implement indexing, storage, and the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method. The objective is to create a chatbot that can handle various questions and deliver accurate information in a user-friendly manner.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pypdf`: A library for extracting text from PDF files.
  - `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
  - `transformers`: Library for natural language processing tasks, especially using pre-trained models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
  - `llama-cpp-python`: A Python wrapper for the Llama Index framework, providing efficient indexing and retrieval functionalities.
  - `llama-index`: Python package for working with the Llama Index framework.
  - `sentence-transformers`: Library for generating sentence embeddings.
- **Hardware**:
  - Utilizing Google Colab for development, leveraging T4 GPU for enhanced processing power.

## Development Process:

### 1. Installation of Required Libraries:
- The initial step involves installing the necessary Python libraries using pip. This includes `pypdf`, `python-dotenv`, `transformers`, `llama-cpp-python`, and `sentence-transformers`.

### 2. Loading Data:
- The data is loaded from a specified directory using the `SimpleDirectoryReader` from the `llama_index` package.

### 3. Model Initialization:
- A LlamaCPP instance is initialized, which involves specifying parameters such as the model URL, temperature, maximum new tokens, context window, and model and generate keyword arguments. This initializes the Llama2 model for generating responses.

### 4. Embedding Model Setup:
- The LangchainEmbedding class is utilized along with HuggingFaceEmbeddings to set up the embedding model for sentence embeddings.

### 5. Service Context Initialization:
- A ServiceContext instance is created with default parameters, including chunk size, Llama2 model, and embedding model.

### 6. Index Creation:
- The VectorStoreIndex is created from the loaded documents and the service context. This index facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of document vectors.

### 7. Query Engine Setup:
- A query engine is created from the index, enabling the chatbot to process user queries and retrieve relevant information.

### 8. Interaction Loop:
- The chatbot enters an interaction loop where it continuously waits for user input. Upon receiving a query, it utilizes the query engine to retrieve relevant information and outputs the response.

## Conclusion:
The developed chatbot successfully integrates various technologies, including the Llama Index framework, transformers for natural language processing, and Google Colab for GPU-accelerated development. With efficient indexing, storage, and retrieval mechanisms, the chatbot can handle diverse user queries and provide accurate information in a user-friendly manner.
